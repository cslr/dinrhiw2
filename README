WHAT DINRHIW2 IS?
-----------------

Primary aim of the dinrhiw is to be linear algebra library and machine learning 
library. For this reason dinrhiw implements PCA and neural
network codes. Currently, the neural network code only supports:

* hamiltonian monte carlo sampling (HMC) and simple bayesian neural network
* second order L-BFGS search
* gradient descent (backpropagation)

.. as well as naive experimental PSO optimizer. 

What is missing then? 

* NO deep learning codes but I hope they could be implemented in the distant future.

BUILDING IT
-----------

To build and install library execute


./build.sh
make install


commands at the top level.


For the working examples how to use dinrhiw look at the tools directory
below the root dictory.

Building it (tst after installing the library) creates three programs:

aescipher - shows how to use AES encryption module.
dstool and nntool - dataset management and neural network weight learning.

So the keyfiles to read for the (neural network) documentation are

tools/nntool.cpp
src/dataset.h
src/neuralnetwork/nnetwork.h

Expecially the latter one shows how to use nnetwork<> class properly to 
learn from the data. Note that it only accepts aprox. [-1,1] valued data
as a default so proper preprocessing of the data using dataset class can
be very important in order to keep data within the correct range 
(+ PCA preprocessing can make the learning from the data exponentially 
   faster in some cases).

IMPORTANT: There is also (alternative) neural network implementation
           in neuralnetwork.h and related files that DO NOT work.

	   However, I plan to make it work and write conversion code
	   to change representation of the network between
	   neuralnetwork <-> nnetwork classes so that you can
	   convert low level (but fast) implementation of nnetwork
	   into higher level representation of the network that
	   is often more easy to understand.

	   This is maybe needed when you want to write special
	   bayesian priors for different neural network layers and
	   convert multilayer restricted boltzman machine (RBM) to
	   initial neural network weights.
	   

Additionally, there are 

tools/test_data.sh
tools/test_data2.sh
tools/test_data3.sh
tools/test_data3_bayes.sh    (SLOW but here bayesian method gives
			      BETTER (bad) result than
			      gradient descent algorithms)

scripts that shows how the learning and data prediction from example data 
works in practice using dstool and nntool commands.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------

The library contains needless implementation of various algorithms
that DO NOT belong to this library. They will be removed slowly
before 1.0 release. (cleanup the code)
