Here I'm going to give step-by-step instructions how to do simple machine learning task using dinrhiw tools: *dstool* and *nntool*.

First compile and install library and tools: 
autoconf; ./configure; make; make makelib; su; make install; exit; and cd tools; make all; su; make install; exit;

After this, lets get some data from UCI machine learning repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.
