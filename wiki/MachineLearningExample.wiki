#summary Example of a simple machine learning task

= Introduction =

Here I'm going to give step-by-step instructions how to do simple machine learning task using dinrhiw tools: *dstool* and *nntool*.

First compile and install library and tools: 
{{{
autoconf; ./configure; make; make makelib; su; make install; exit;
}}} 

and 

{{{ 
cd tools; make all; su; make install; exit;
}}}

After this, lets get some data from UCI machine learning repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.

Specifically, we are going to do machine learning to predict wine quality of different wines based on measurements: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.

{{{
wget http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv
}}}

After this
