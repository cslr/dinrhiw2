Dstool is the helper program for nntool which will be probably merged with nntool at some point. It reads comma-separated CVS-formatted ASCII data and stores it into format nntool can understand. 

*DATA* <=> *DSTOOL* <=> *NNTOOL*

Command-line arguments of dstool are:
{{{
Usage: datatool <command> <datafile> [asciifile | datafile]
A tool for manipulating whiteice::dataset files.

 -list                      lists clusters, number of datapoints, preprocessings.
                            (default action)
 -print[:<c1>[:<b>[:<e>]]]  prints contents of cluster c1 (indexes [<b>,<e>])
 -create                    creates new empty dataset (<dataset> file doesn't exist)
 -create:<dim>[:name]       creates new empty <dim> dimensional dataset cluster
 -import:<c1>               imports data from comma separated CSV ascii file to cluster c1
 -export:<c1>               exports data from cluster c1 to comma separated CSV ascii file
 -add:<c1>:<c2>             adds data from another datafile cluster c2 to c1
 -move:<c1>:<c2>            moves data (internally) from cluster c2 to c1
 -copy:<c1>:<c2>            copies data (internally) from cluster c2 to c1
 -clear:<c1>                clears dataset cluster c1 (but doesn't remove cluster)
 -remove:<c1>               removes dataset cluster c1
 -padd:<c1>:<name>+         adds preprocessing(s) to cluster
 -premove:<c1>:<name>+      removes preprocesing(s) from cluster
                            preprocess names: meanvar, outlier, pca, ica
                            note: ica implementation is unstable and may not work
 -data:N                    jointly resamples all cluster sizes down to N datapoints

  # The *list* command lists dataset information: the number of datapoints, clusters and their preprocessing methods. It exists just for informational and testing purposes.
  # Similarly, the *print* command prints given clusters datapoints for debugging purposes.
  # The *create* command creates a new cluster into dataset containing D dimensions. The importing of data into dataset always starts with this command.
  # *import* and *export* commands are used to bring and save data to/from dataset and are most important commands that one needs to use when wanting to process datafile with nntool.
  # *add*, *move*, *copy*, *clear* and *remove* commands are seldom used and can be used to move datapoints between clusters
  # the *padd* command another essential command that can be used to preprocess data before it is fed to neural network. The _meanvar_ is maybe the most essential command here as it removed mean and normalizes variance of (input) data to unity making it nice to work with nntool's neural network implementation.
 # *premove* command can be used to remove preprocessings from data.
 # *data* command JOINTLY downsamples number of datapoints from all clusters down to N datapoints. This requires that number of datapoints in each cluster is  the same in each cluster (the usual case).
