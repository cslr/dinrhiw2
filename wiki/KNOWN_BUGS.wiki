# Knowns bugs in dinrhiw2 library

Code is only tested and known to compile on Debian/Linux (amd64).

  * The problem may be in NNGradDescent code seem to have some strange bug. It causes strange bad_alloc() errors if used in combination with other methods.

  * OUT OF MEMORY problems with BIG neural networks or BIG DATA leads to strange error messages that are not properly handled.

  * ICA code probably has some bugs (with bad data)

  * nntool requires intel or amd (IA32, AMD64) cpu platforms as some parts of the code uses native CPUID or other instructions.

  * IMPORTANT: reading (and writing) dataset files FAILs on MinGW/Win32 platform:  does not happen on Cygwin32 so it seems this is a compiler bug (gcc)? or a strange data access error. run valgrind on 32bit linux platform (create a VM machine)

  * realnumber (arbitrary precision math): sin() and cos() function calls fail as they are not implemented.
