#summary misc detailed notes what to do (short-term internal dev)

LIST:

  * write job application(s)
  * increase version numbers
  * IMPLEMENT ica-based basis regularization of neural network training
  * take realnumber implementation out of dinrhiw make a new library *libvilya* - unlimited precision integer and floating point math (unlimited power) - experiment heavily with perfect forwarding of rvalues here and write *FAST* operator overloading library for real (and complex) numbers
  * write sin/cos and other numerical functions for libvilya
  * implement perfect forwarding of rvalues in linear algebra (matrix/vertex operators) in dinrhiw
