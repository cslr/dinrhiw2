#summary misc detailed notes what to do (short-term internal dev)

LIST:

  * make all initialization codes (LBFGS, BFGS, NNGradDescent) to use ICA-prepriming
  * improve overfit-detection (asinh non-linearity optimization causes easily temporal increases in error function) to allow temporal increases (calculate minimum found and do not stop unless we increase more than 10% from it or something): LBFGS, BFGS, grad, parallelgrad
  * write job application(s)
  * increase version numbers
  * merge nntool and datatool
  * create statically linked nntool (compress using upx) and distribute it
  * implement perfect forwarding of rvalues in linear algebra (matrix/vertex operators) in dinrhiw

FURTHER TEST asinh(x) non-linearity. This time with time-series signals.
