Interesting revision numbers:

142 - src/neuralnetwork/octave/  - stacked RBM implementation (stackedRBM_test.m) kind of works now.
				   it uses G-B RBM at the first layer and then B-B RBMs 
				   to process hidden states

152  				   update rule for variance, octave GBRBM code still works but now I try to modify it

231 - tools/nntool   	     	   nntool (codenamed "narya") can now pretrain neural network weights using stacked RBMs (deep learning)!
      				   more work is needed to make the code more robust.

				   also, sigmoid-function is now the default non-linearity in nnetwork code because
				   it fits well together with RBM code

257				   support for multiple different non-linearities in code (save&load) and simple recursive nnetworks)

264				   nntool has now working simple recurrent neural network optimization/support (not fully tested)
				   (it seems that using mostly linear neural network is beneficial for large recurrent nnetworks
				    so that it can be trained while having just enough non-linearitiness so that resulting system
				    is not linear)

				   nntool also uses doubles instead of single precision numbers now internally.
				   extra accuracy can be useful when optimization requires near zero gradients or
				   so that we do not get easily infinities.
