Interesting revision numbers:

142 - src/neuralnetwork/octave/  - stacked RBM implementation (stackedRBM_test.m) kind of works now.
				   it uses G-B RBM at the first layer and then B-B RBMs 
				   to process hidden states

152  				   update rule for variance, octave GBRBM code still works but now I try to modify it

231 - tools/nntool   	     	   nntool (codenamed "narya") can now pretrain neural network weights using stacked RBMs (deep learning)!
      				   more work is needed to make the code more robust.

				   also, sigmoid-function is now the default non-linearity in nnetwork code because
				   it fits well together with RBM code

257				   support for multiple different non-linearities in code (save&load) and simple recursive nnetworks)
