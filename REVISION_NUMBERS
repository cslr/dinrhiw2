Interesting revision numbers:

142 - src/neuralnetwork/octave/  - stacked RBM implementation (stackedRBM_test.m) kind of works now.
				   it uses G-B RBM at the first layer and then B-B RBMs 
				   to process hidden states

152 - update rule for variance, octave GBRBM code still works but now I try to modify it
