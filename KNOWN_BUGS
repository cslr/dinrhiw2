Code is only tested and known to compile on Debian/Linux (amd64) and 
Windows 64bit platform. Minimal testing has been done on Intel 32bit plaform.

* HMC (bayes nnetwork) do not work properly on more that
  one dimension nnetwork..
  
* BFGS optimizer (but not L-BFGS) fails mysteriously
  when optimizing large nnetworks
  (vertex dimension mismatch with large nnetworks)
  

* OUT OF MEMORY problems with BIG neural networks or BIG DATA
  leads to strange error messages that are not properly handled.

* ICA code probably has some bugs (with bad/singular data)

* static linking of nntool causes problems due to gcc compiler bug

* nntool requires intel or amd (IA32, AMD64) cpu platforms as
  some parts of the code uses native CPUID or other instructions.

* realnumber (arbitrary precision math): sin() and cos() function calls fail
  as they are not properly implemented.
