Code is only tested and known to compile on Debian/Linux (amd64) and 
Windows 64bit platform. Minimal testing has been done on Intel 32bit plaform.

* Compiler GCC >= 9.* is required because GCC 8.* compiler has bugs in class random_device implementation.

* t-SNE don't scale to data points large than N=1000 well. (O(N^2) instead of O(N*log(N)
  because no Barnes-Hut approximation.

* VAE code (Variational Autoencoder) currently doesn't handle learning z-space model variance well.
  is it possible to alter computation to use zvariance = encoder_stdev(x)*encoder_stdev(x) and handle related math correctly?

* HMC (bayes nnetwork) do not work properly on more that
  one output dimension nnetwork? (recheck)

* OUT OF MEMORY problems with BIG neural networks or BIG DATA
  leads to strange error messages that are not properly handled.

* static linking of nntool causes problems due to known gcc compiler bug

* realnumber (arbitrary precision math): sin() and cos() function calls fail
  as they are not properly implemented.
  
* Sylvester Equation solver hasn't been working for a long time but is not needed (won't fix)

* matrix<T>::symmetric_pseudoinverse() don't handle complex numbers correctly.
  symmetric_eig() to properly handle complex numbers so the code can be enabled.
