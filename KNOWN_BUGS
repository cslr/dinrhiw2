Code is only tested and known to compile on Debian/Linux (amd64).
It has been reported to work on Cygwin32 bit platform.
It currently does NOT work on MinGW32/win32 platform because

* neural network code: nnetwork has some bugs(?),
  valgrind everything (testcases) and RECHECK/REREAD nnetwork code carefully.
  (read backpropagation/gradient code carefully)

* HMC nnetwork sampler maybe BUGGY and need more testing
  - write testcases for sampling mixture of normal distributions and
    see visually (octave datafile import) that results are correct

* ICA code probably has some bugs (with bad data)

* nntool requires intel or amd (IA32, AMD64) cpu platforms as
  some parts of the code uses native CPUID or other instructions.

* IMPORTANT: reading (and writing) dataset files FAILs on MinGW/Win32 platform:
    - does not happen on Cygwin32 so it seems this is a compiler bug (gcc)?
    - or a strange data access error. run valgrind on 32bit linux platform
      (create a VM machine)

* BFGS optimization DO NOT work (is not complete) and is buggy. 
  This would be nice to use when training neural networks so
  it's robust implementation would be nice.

* realnumber (arbitrary precision math): sin() and cos() function calls fail
  as they are not implemented.

- there is no normal random number generator (randn rng) which
  would be nice when testing sampling codes
  (ziggurat method for normal numbers)
