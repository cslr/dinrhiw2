Code is only tested and known to compile on Debian/Linux (amd64).
It has been reported to work on Cygwin32 bit platform.
It currently does NOT work on MinGW32/win32 platform, maybe because of compiler bugs(?).

* neural network code: nnetwork has some bugs(?),
  valgrind everything (testcases) and RECHECK/REREAD nnetwork code carefully.
  (read backpropagation/gradient code carefully)

  * The problem may be in NNGradDescent code (threading?)

* BFGS and LBFGS parallel code has rare threading/synchronization issues
  (thread_running is MODIFIED by theading loop but somebody may get/modify
   the thread_running (mutex) BEFORE we exit)

* OUT OF MEMORY problems with BIG neural networks or BIG DATA
  leads to strange error messages that are not properly handled.

* ICA code probably has some bugs (with bad data)

* nntool requires intel or amd (IA32, AMD64) cpu platforms as
  some parts of the code uses native CPUID or other instructions.

* IMPORTANT: reading (and writing) dataset files FAILs on MinGW/Win32 platform:
    - does not happen on Cygwin32 so it seems this is a compiler bug (gcc)?
    - or a strange data access error. run valgrind on 32bit linux platform
      (create a VM machine)

* realnumber (arbitrary precision math): sin() and cos() function calls fail
  as they are not implemented.
