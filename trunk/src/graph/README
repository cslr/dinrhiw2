 c++ implementation of basic graph algorithms
 (reason: learn & remember (for exam) + useful,100% the way you like it implementation)

TODO
PARTIAL: (todo - integrate/merge from "AI")
	graphs, extend to generic weighted (or not) graphs
	trees (black-red) (special case of graphs)              

TODO:
	binomial heaps
	fibonacci heaps

	merge "edit distance code" to graph makefile + tests

	
	minimum spanning trees
	
	some kind of dynamic programming/optimization framework
	disjoint set implementation
	
	shortest path problem - solutions
	maximum flow solution(s) for graphs

too bad coding these well would take too much. -> implemented after exam period
