simple threaded abstract digital components simulation

  this uses very many threads ((inpractically many)
  so if threading implementation isn't fast this
  simulation isn't either. On the contrary it makes
  implementation simple and easily extendable.

uses:
 - simulation/education/testing

 - generic function framework for learning
   logical functions and testing of
   optimization algorithms

in the future if more functionality is added:
   (clock synchroniation based components)
 - for generic parameterized function approximation
   framework (optimization etc.) which can be
   then implemented in real world

   (simulation with signal propagation delay)
 - simulation for optimizing wiring in circuit

 - near real simulation if all the above + floating
   point values between 0 and 1 are possible +
   simulation which takes into account non-idealization
   of components
