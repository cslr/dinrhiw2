Porting to Windows with MinGW g++
---------------------------------

whiteice::ALGOS requires whiteice::DLIB which have been ported to Windows.
ALGOS requires:
 - ATLAS (CBLAS, linear algebra basic operations)
 - libgmp (large integers)
 - pthreads

practice:

libgmp compilation just works (ok)

ATLAS "make config" just hangs (xconfig idles at 0%)
  worked with older setup. Now problem with system() call.
  (config.c) ("System cannot find path specified.")
  
  installed older libs and headers 
  (compiled with older cygwin+mingw combination)
  /usr/local/lib/3dnow
  /usr/local/include


pthreads
  MinGW don't have pthreads so one needs to install them.
  Pthreads-Win32 library (LGPL) can be found from
  http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/
  get source & compile it.
  install to /c/MinGW/include and lib
  rename library files to be libpthread.a 
  (remove end suffixes)




COMPILATION PROBLEMS:

timed_boolean.h: #include <sys/times.h> not in MINGW. Not used can be commented out. OK

TODO:
timed_boolean.h: no gettimeofday() in MINGW. Code implementation for Windows (easy):
  - TEST (SEPARATE FILE.C -> A.EXE, COMPARE WITH UNIX OUTPUT (DIFF IS SMALL IF CLOCKS ARE IN SYNC (SHOW IN USER READABLE FORM)
    AND ADD AUTOCONF CHECK FOR GETTIMEOFDAY()
