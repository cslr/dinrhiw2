	LOTS of changes. Moved to whiteice namespace. Lots of new code
	has been coded between the last log entry (changelog hasn't been used)
	Code currently has:
	basic data structures, basic (still non-optimized) cryptographic code
	(add modes of operation and AES is fully implemented),
	basic mathematical, linear algebra code, simple curve fitting,
	some optimization code: global optimization (stochastic search),
	BFGS (aprox 2nd order Hessian descent) optimizer,
	particle swarm optimizer (PSO), linear programming (optimization) solver,
	symmetric eigenvalue solvers, PCA, ICA, 
	neural networks: backpropagation and PSO (BGFS ahould be added),
	(bayesian neural networks and causal bayesian networks are
	 to be implemented in dinrhiw library), SOM.

	TODO (not to be implemented soon): SVM, bayesian neural network
	GDA clustering (dinrhiw or algos), simple polynomial and 
	bayesian neural network SND,

	I started to use "cis_algos" namespace. (generically: main directory based namespaces)
	I'll make changes to whole cis_algos directory gradually.
	Global namespace will be "whiteice".
	So whiteice::cis_algos , whiteice::dlib_global , whiteice::cndi , 
	   whiteice::ai  etc. will be used.
