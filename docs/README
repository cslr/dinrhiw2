	Implementation of lots of basic algorithms for core library.

classes/interfaces:
	container     <interface>
	array         <interface>
	queue         <interface>
	stack         <interface>
	
	static_array  <array class>
	dynamic_array <array class>
	
	we're written when it was thought (incorrectly that using
	libstdc++ implementation would bring code under GPL. - this
	seems to be quite common misconception about libstdc++ .

	There's libstc++ is using modified GPL, called "runtime GPL" which
	has following additional clause:
	[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/license.html]:
	
	  "As a special exception, you may use this file as part of a free software
   library without restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate
   templates or use macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile
   this file and link it with other files to produce an executable, this
   file does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however
   invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
   the GNU General Public License."


	
	See also local copy "libstdc_license.html" for details.
	
	They will be only maintained because some derived code
	partly uses them (hash implementation at least).
	Additionally interfaces may be useful in the future.
