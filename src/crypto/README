Cryptographic implementations:

[DES.h]: DES, triple DES
[AES.h]: AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
[PAD.h]: one time PAD
[SHA.h|: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-358, SHA-512
[RSA.h]: RSA
[DSA.h]: DSA


---------------------------------------------

 Current implementations are enough for own
use in the near future.



 Symmetric key based 'signing': can be implemented
by crypting data with AES and when one gets data
back decrypting it (and keeping the key secret).

This is useful for the cases where you have (game)
server which saves data/state on the (player/)users
machine but don't want to make user to be able to change it.
