/*
 * very basic
 * genetic algorithm for function optimization
 *
 * TODO: optimize, make more robust, faster, improve.
 *
 * idea: if / when lots of example values of x are
 * available, turn them to bits easily (direct binary string)
 * bits(x) and then use ica/pca to gaussianice/minimize information
 * between bits. x_ = ica(bits(x)). this should remove same information between
 * bits - bits cannot 'conflict' if b1 != b2. However making correlation matrix Rx = I
 * would be probably better/easier idea.
 *
 * If bits cannot conflict then feature which bits code is either on or off.
 * and not in-between. good/bad thing?
 *
 * for example changing representation of bits *during* optimization
 * determinized by:  ica(bits(x_good_ones)). -> coding is optimized to
 * represent information for good candidates very compactly ->
 * more bits left for coding extra features for good ones to improve.
 *
 * however: this makes mutation to be more disasterious (if it's not very good - common).
 *
 * ---
 * Some soft of histogram equalization could be also be a good method for keeping
 * distribution of genes 'flat' and without peaks. -> this kind of 'zooms' in to
 * peak so that the problem space is again flat: -> well used number of variables.
 * (uses whole problem space/dimensionality well for solving the problem).
 * ---
 *
 * above:
 * kind of feedback between 'preprocessing' stage (choosing of representation)
 * and optimization stage
 * or better (view point):  integrates choose of representation and actual optimization
 * into one task, actually kind of EM method when you think it:
 *    representation is constantly optimized for optimization task (needed parameters
 *       are constantly changing: optimizes for current instance (expected value) )
 *    and optimization optimizes normally.
