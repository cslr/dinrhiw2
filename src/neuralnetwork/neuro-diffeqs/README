PROJECT MADY BY TOMAS UKKONEN 2022 
==================================


TODO

-diff.eq. model from residual relu neural network with 4 layers (10-10-10-10),
 take 2 first dim for coordinates
	  
-runge-kutta simulation of diff.eq. neural network
-visualize trajectory from random neural network

* ADD COMPLEX VALUE SUPPORT FOR COMPLEX VALUED  diff.eqs. (waves etc)



- generate test data from random network
- model and model fitting with HMC sampler and sample from p(w|error) (bayesian) minimizing error
  -  low number of parameters to make sampling practical (<500 parameter values in neural net)
-
